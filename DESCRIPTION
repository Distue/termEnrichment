Description: This packages tests for overrepresentation for multiple termes (e.g.
    GO terms, protein domains, pathways) for a set of features against a
    background. Enrichment is calculated using Fisher's exact test. 
    It uses BiocParallel for fast computation and provides
    visualisation for the enriched terms.
Imports: tibble, dplyr, ggplot2, graphics, utils, stats, lazyeval
